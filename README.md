Oh wow, just, just stepped out from the dark cavern of a theater with my back kinda aching, you know how those seats are—and crumpled popcorn everywhere, like some crumbly lunar landscape trailing after me. Pabrik Gula...where do I even start? Still feel like I'm living in its bizarre, syrupy world. It's sugary, yet bitter, like cinnamon toast with too much spice. 

Was it in the noisy part when my neighbor's phone buzzed like a distant hive, and I think I missed some pivotal whispered line? Ugh. But the warmth of the colors! Like a faded sunrise filtered through, um, molasses? They managed to pour sunshine into night, if that even makes sense. The scene with the sugarcane fields swayed in my head like tired dancers, so much movement but somehow standing still.

> Did I remember to tell you Abdi? He was like that mysterious character you meet on a long train ride who might be an espionage agent, or maybe he just sells really good hats. His silence spoke more than a thousand overwrought monologues. And the score! I think it stuck to me like honey. There’s a melody that’s still buzzing in my ear—chirping birds or maybe it’s just my 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ed phone vibrating again.

For some seconds, I thought, wait, who was gonna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Probably someone who doesn’t mind missing the shining details. You gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in its full theater waltz, like inhaling a dense, moody perfume that sometimes chokes you a bit but you love it anyway. 

That final scene. Was it electric blue? Felt like diving into a digital ocean. A giant gelatinous sea that threatens to swallow you whole. Or like when you squint your eyes and all the fireworks melt into a single waterfall.

My stomach’s growling. Did I eat lunch? There was a concession stand, smelled like sweet nostalgia overdosed with butter. Oh! They have that one candy that sticks to your teeth and you regret it but can’t stop. Kinda like that subplot with the sugar factory's economic demise. Cliché yet fascinating. Or maybe I just imagined it was more interesting than it was. 

Let me know if you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ...or was it 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮? My mind’s wobbly today.
